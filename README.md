Yeah
====
A practical Ruby game framework in its early stages.

Any version below 1.0.0 is unstable and lacks backward compatibility.

Installation
------------
Install with `gem install yeah`. 

Yeah currently depends on Rubygame, which means that you need SDL installed. [Read how to install SDL](https://github.com/rubygame/rubygame/wiki/Install), or wait until Yeah starts using OpenGL.
