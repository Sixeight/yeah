Yeah
====
An early-stage Ruby video game framework that optimizes for development efficiency.

Any version below 1.0.0 is unstable and lacks backward compatibility. At version 0.3.0 the Vyzer demo should be functional.

Installation
------------
Install with `gem install yeah`. Yeah depends on Rubygame, which means that you need SDL - [read instructions to install](https://github.com/rubygame/rubygame/wiki/Install).
