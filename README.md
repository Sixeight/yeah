Pragmatic Ruby video game library

Ruby is a good fit for game development for the following reasons:
* Ruby is optimized for developer happiness, and this library will be, too. A happy developer is a productive developer, which translates into more games made and with greater passion.
* Ruby has great object-oriented syntax that makes a lot of sense for game constructs.
* Ruby's expressiveness reduces development time and makes it easier to experiment.
* Ruby supports operator overloading, which is very handy for the linear algebra that is typically abundant in game code.
* Software testing is wonderful and ubiquitous in the Ruby community, but the game development community has not embraced it. I hope this library helps change that.
* [Rubygame](https://github.com/rubygame/rubygame/), [Opal](https://github.com/opal/opal), [Ruboto](https://github.com/ruboto/ruboto) and [MobiRuby](https://github.com/mobiruby/mobiruby-ios) would allow for targeting the desktop, web, and mobile using the same codebase.
* The Ruby and indie game communities are both so quirky. It's a match made in heaven.
