Yeah
====
An early-stage Ruby video game framework that optimizes for development efficiency.

It is in very early stages, but at version 0.3.0 the Shootguy demo should be functional. Any version below 1.0.0 is unstable and lacks backward compatibility.

Planned features
----------------
* An opinionated, modular API that makes common tasks easy and everything else possible.
* Command line initialization script to help one hit the ground running.
* Graphical tools for creating video game resources like sprites and maps.
* Multiple target platforms, starting with desktop and web.

Installation
------------
Install with `gem install yeah`. Yeah depends on Rubygame, which depends on SDL; see [these guides](https://github.com/rubygame/rubygame/wiki/Install).
